                    Let me help make your academic, reference, and nonfiction books a little easier
                    to understand. I create comprehensive back-of-the-book indexes,
                    allowing your readers to identify and quickly find key topics within the text.
                </p>
                <p class="introduction">
                    I thoroughly enjoy indexing. I love being exposed to a wide variety of ideas and
                    topics as well as the challenge of converting an author's perspective into reader-
                    friendly index entries.
                </p>
                <p class="introduction">
                    I have created indexes on an eclectic mix of subjects ranging from biodiversity in
                    gardens to the natural history of dinosaurs. My specialties and interests are in the
                    agricultural sciences (botany, gardening and landscaping, local food movements) as well
                    as issues concerning education, hunger and poverty, health, and current social/political
                    movements.
                </p>
                <p class="introduction">
                    My indexing work is professional, thorough, and reader-friendly. I understand the time
                    constraints in publishing, and always meet deadlines.

                        Barbara Murphy combines her academic and personal expertise to
                        create accurate, professional and timely back-of-the-book as well as
                        embedded indexes.  She obtained her Masters of Science degree in Plant,
                        Soils and Environmental Science from the University of Maine and
                        was an associate professor with the University of Maine Cooperative Extension
                        for 23 years. Barbara also has hands-on experience in small-scale organic
                        vegetable and specialty plant production as well as organizing community efforts.

                        When she is not indexing, she is part of Gardeners Growing Healthy
                        Communities. They are a volunteer group of gardeners and cooks who believe
                        sharing garden harvests promotes health and thriving communities.
