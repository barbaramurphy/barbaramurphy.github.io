                    Let me help make your academic, reference, and nonfiction books a little easier
                    to understand. I create comprehensive back-of-the-book and embedded indexes,
                    allowing your readers to identify and find key topics within the text.
                </p>
                <p class="introduction">
                    When creating an index, I first  read your work and extract the important terms
                    and subjects, balancing a
                    desire to be thorough with an understanding that no reader wishes to dig
                    through dozens of pages to track down the phrase they are searching for. Once I
                    have created a preliminary list of topics, I take to Sky indexing software and
                    the Chicago Manual of Style to produce a formatted, embedded index. From there,
                    I will shape
                    your index based off of your preferences.

                        Barbara Murphy combines her academic and personal expertise to
                        create accurate, professional and timely back-of-the-book as well as
                        embedded indexes.  She obtained her Masters of Science degree in Plant,
                        Soils and Environmental Science from the University of Maine in 1992 and
                        went on to a 23-year career as an associate professor with the University of
                        Maine Cooperative Extension. There, she focused on horticulture,
                        agricultural sciences, hunger and poverty. Barbara also has hands-on
                        experience in small-scale organic vegetable production as well as organizing
                        successful community gardens. She brings decades of experience in teaching,
                        both with students and adults.

                        In 2015 she successfully completed the University of California Berkeley
                        course, Indexing: Theory and Application.

                        When she is not indexing, she is part of Gardeners Growing Healthy
                        Communities. They are a volunteer group of gardeners and cooks who believe
                        sharing garden harvests promotes health and thriving communities. They plant,
                        maintain and harvest three gardens as well as gather donations from local farms
                        and backyard gardeners. All of the produce is then distributed directly to
                        individuals who have limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables.
